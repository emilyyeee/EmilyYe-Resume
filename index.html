        <p class="lead mb-4">I learned through a remote learning environment in my first year of college due to the pandemic. However, it was a special experience for an incoming university student. Prior to the quarter starting, I was excited to experience college life, I think it has to be more interesting than high school. I could see larger school buildings, new teachers and new students. But the truth is I stayed home and went to classes through zoom meetings. It was really different from other freshmen in the past. Being a freshman this year, I can't experience the dream college life I have imagined before. At that time, I felt depressed because I canâ€™t go look around my new school and make new friends. I canâ€™t be in a lecture class with hundreds of students in the classroom. Even so, I have to start my first quarter. I set some goals at the start of the quarter. First, I wanted to get good grades, and achieve a 4.0 GPA. Second, I want to make some new friends. Lastly, get adapted and comfortable to the new school.<br><br>

        To meet the goals, I went to every class and didnâ€™t ditch any of the classes. I went to every lecture and discussion class, so I wonâ€™t get behind. I managed my time and did assignments the professors have provided. I turned in all the homework on time and maintained a good grade. Also, I studied before quizzes and midterms, and tried my best on the test day. I knew I was on the right track, and still keeping a good grade until now. Even though my final grade is not out yet, I believe it wonâ€™t be too bad. My second goal is making new friends. To meet this goal, I have joined the group chat of each of my classes. Most of the group chats have a lot of people inside. People wonâ€™t talk too much. Unlike my writing class, our professor separated us in the breakout room, and we used to be in the same breakout room. There are five students in my breakout room, we talked a lot and had our own group chat now. I made new friends and I am glad to know them. Lastly, I set the last goal to get adapted to the new school. I never took online classes before so it was my first time studying at home. It was uncomfortable at first because it was hard to communicate with professors and classmates, we couldn't make any interaction together. Also, I might get confused at some point for getting unclear information. However, I tried to listen carefully and asked questions after the class for any misunderstanding. I got adapted easily and more used to this remote learning environment. <br><br>

        My successes in the first quarter was that I reached all my goals. I got used to the new learning environment, got good grades and made new friends. The missteps I made during the first quarter was I always procrastinate to do my homework even though I turned in on time. I like to do my homework at the last minute, which is a bad idea. I should improve and set up a goal for the new quarter to fix this bad habit. Also, my basic writing class is a S/NC class, the professor graded harshly on our exam, and itâ€™s not easy to pass this course. I also realized that I was bad at grammar, so I should put more effort into practicing grammar later on. Moreover, I was lucky to have nice professors in all of my courses. At last, I will be better prepared for the winter quarter that is coming soon.
